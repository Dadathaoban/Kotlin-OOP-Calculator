# Kotlin OOP Calculator

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple calculator application developed using **Kotlin** in **Android Studio**.  
It demonstrates the practical use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts while performing four basic mathematical operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

The application is designed for learning purposes and focuses on clean code structure, readability, and proper use of Kotlin language features.

## 🎯 Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to:
- Apply OOP principles in Kotlin
- Use `class`, `object`, `constructor`, and `enum class`
- Implement decision-making using Kotlin’s `when` expression
- Perform arithmetic operations in a structured and type-safe manner

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

### 1. Class
A `Calculator` class is created to encapsulate calculator behavior and data.

### 2. Constructor
The constructor initializes two operands required for calculations.

### 3. Object
An instance of the `Calculator` class is created to perform operations.

### 4. Enum Class
An enum class named `Operations` defines the supported arithmetic operations:
- `ADD`
- `SUBTRACT`
- `MULTIPLY`
- `DIVIDE`

---

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. Two operands are passed to the `Calculator` class using its constructor.
2. An enum value representing the desired operation is passed to a function.
3. Kotlin’s `when` clause determines which operation to execute.
4. The result is returned based on the selected operation.
